# Data Science Capstone Project (Choosing the best classifier)

This project is a part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to find the best classifier to predict if the first stage of Falcon9 rocket will land successfully or not which in-turn can be used to determine and minimize the cost by SpaceX.

### Methods Used
* Web Scraping
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning

### Technologies used
* Python
* SQL
* Jupyter

### Stages
* Data Collection - Data is collected using API integration with SpaceX API and by using BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from Wikipedia
* Data Wrangling - After collecting the required data, data is cleaned and made useful for further analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis - Data is now analysed using various statistical techniques and using SQL to get to know more about the data for further stages of the project
* Data Visualization - Data is analyzed using various visualization techniques to get a deep understanding of data to use various features of data effectively in model creation
* Machine Learning - Now data is standardized and separated into train and test data to be used in various models and then finding the best hyperparameter to be used in various models, now using these parameters to find the best performing classifier.
